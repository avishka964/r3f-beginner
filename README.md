# React Three Fiber Beginner Guide

1. Declarative Syntax: Developers can use JSX, the syntax extension for JavaScript often associated with React, to define and structure 3D scenes.

2. Component-Based: R3F follows the component-based architecture of React, allowing developers to create reusable and composable 3D components.

3. Integration with Three.js: React Three Fiber is built on top of Three.js, providing a React-friendly layer over the powerful capabilities of Three.js. It simplifies the creation and manipulation of 3D objects, cameras, lights, and other elements.

4. Hooks API: R3F introduces a set of hooks that allow developers to interact with the underlying Three.js instances, enabling dynamic updates and animations.
